During the process of researching inlining, I created new versions of templates pre-processed through premailer.io for this. Ultimately, they would not be needed.

For the time being, here's the directories they are in:

originals
- the code files that was working before I started approaching inlining for Gmail

source
- the code with block of css up front with php removed for processing in premailer

Oxygen
- the open source oxygen sendwithus templates in use

processed
- the files after premailer, that I ultimately did not need. silly me.
